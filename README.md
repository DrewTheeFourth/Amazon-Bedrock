# Amazon-Bedrock - GENERATING A VISUAL PARTY PLANNER APP WITH PARTYROCK.

ABOUT PARTYROCK

 Partyrock is a new hands-on code-free app building playground that allows anyone to create a generative AI applications without writing any code.

This simply means, to create an application you have to be declarative (tell Partyrock what to do by giving it a description of your desired application).

It is powered by Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that provides access to foundation models from Amazon and leading AI companies through an API.

With Partyrock, you can experiment with various generative AI capabilities, including text generation, image generation, and prompt engineering.

PROJECT SUMMARY 

The idea to create a visual party planner AI application using Partyrock was suggested by ChatGPT. The command to create the application was as follows:

Create an app that helps users plan and organize virtual parties. Features can include:

1. Invitations: Customizable e-invites.

2. RSVP Management: Track guest responses.

3. Themes: Choose from various party themes and suggestions for decorations.

4. Games: Integrate party games like trivia, charades, and scavenger hunts.

5. Music Playlists: Curate playlists from popular streaming services. 

CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED

 There was not a single challenge I encountered since the use of Partyrock is declarative. 

TECHNOLOGIES EMPLOYED

 I used some AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity . I also resorted the good old YouTube to get a visual lesson on how to use Partyrock.

P.S: Someone may ask "why did you choose this, it seems a bit unconventional." and absolutely I agree with you, it is quite unconventional in the sense that it is in line with the trend of the latest cloud technologies. First of all, Amazon Bedrock is fairly new to the public and is promising to be invaluable to the tech bubble as a whole, as it is packed with a ton of AI and machine learning features, so in order to retune my mind in that direction (I like to think it is the direction of the future), I chose this project to streamline the whole process.
